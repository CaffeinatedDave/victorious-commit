Victorious Commit
-----------------

Make committing more fun!

This is a post-commit hook for git that will play the Final Fantasy victory
theme after a successful commit. copy post-commit (and applescript-commit
for Mac OS X) into .git/hooks, then put FinalFantasyVictory.mp3 into ~/lib,
and finally, revel in the glory of victory.

Requires afplay (installed by default on OS X).
