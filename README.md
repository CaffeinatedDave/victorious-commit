-----------------

Make committing more fun!

This is a post-commit hook for git that will play the Final Fantasy victory
theme after a successful commit. copy post-commit into .git/hooks, then put
FinalFantasyVictory.mp3  (and applescript-commit for OS X) into ~/lib, and
finally, revel in the glory of victory.

Requires afplay (installed by default on OS X).
